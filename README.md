Bootcamp Week One Challenge: 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

The goal of this project was to add semantic HTML elements and accessibility features so the marketing agency client horiseon has a site that is optimized for search engines.

This project was edited from starter code to have better SEO by adding alt text to images, and adding semantic HTML elements. Additionally the CSS Style sheet was edited to better utilize the new semantic html elements.

I learned more semantic HTML elements, as well as  how to apply CSS without needing to use classes and ids. I learned how to comment on code to write notes to myself and future developers. This code has made no visual changes to the original code, but offers improved SEO through alt text for images and semantic HTML
